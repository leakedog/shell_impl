# Custom Shell Implementation
This shell is designed to provide a versatile command-line interface, supporting various features and functionalities. Below is an overview of what the shell can do:

## Features
* `Command Execution`: The shell reads commands from both standard input and files, allowing users to interactively input commands or execute scripts.

* `Redirections`: Support for input and output redirections, enabling users to control where the command's input comes from and where its output goes.

* `Pipes`: Seamless integration of pipes to connect multiple commands, enabling complex command pipelines.

* `Built-in Functions`: We have implemented custom-built functions to enhance the shell's capabilities. These functions are designed to provide additional functionality and improve the overall user experience.

To get comprehensive information on what functionalities are implemented , please refer to the documentation available in the "doc" folder.
